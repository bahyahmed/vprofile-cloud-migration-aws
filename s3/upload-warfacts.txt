# 📦 Upload WAR File to S3 Bucket

This guide explains how to upload the built WAR artifact (`vprofile-v2.war`) to an S3 bucket so that it can be fetched by the Tomcat EC2 instance.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Build the Application

Run the following Maven command to build the WAR file and skip tests:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

✅ **Output Location**
After the build, the WAR file will be located at:

```
target/vprofile-v2.war
```

---

### ☁️ Step 2: Upload to S3

Use the AWS CLI to upload the WAR file:

```bash
aws s3 cp target/vprofile-v2.war s3://<your-s3-bucket-name>/vprofile-v2.war
```

> Replace `<your-s3-bucket-name>` with your actual S3 bucket name.

---

### 🔐 Step 3: Ensure EC2 Access Permissions

Make sure your EC2 instance has:

* An **IAM Role** attached with `s3:GetObject` permission.
* The correct **S3 bucket policy** (if needed) to allow access.

---

### 💡 Optional: Generate Pre-signed URL

To create a temporary download link for the WAR file:

```bash
aws s3 presign s3://<your-s3-bucket-name>/vprofile-v2.war --expires-in 3600
```

---

### 🧪 Example

Upload WAR file:

```bash
aws s3 cp target/vprofile-v2.war s3://vprofile-artifacts-prod/vprofile-v2.war
```

Then in your EC2 user data script (e.g., `tomcat.sh`):

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://vprofile-artifacts-prod/vprofile-v2.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
```
